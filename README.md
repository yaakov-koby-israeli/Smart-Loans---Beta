# Smart Loans - Beta

## Overview

Smart Loans - Beta is a decentralized, blockchain-powered lending system that provides a secure, transparent, and automated way to manage loans. The system leverages **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **Ethereum smart contracts** to enable seamless financial transactions between borrowers and lenders without intermediaries.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login with JWT-based authentication and hashed passwords.
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, lenders, and borrowers have different permissions.
- **Loan Management**: Loan requests, approvals, repayments, and overdue penalties.
- **Blockchain Security**: Transactions are executed via Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Automated Payments**: Loan repayments and penalties are enforced using smart contracts.
- **FastAPI-Based Backend**: High-performance API using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
- **Web3 Integration**: Blockchain transactions executed via Ganache Ethereum simulation.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy + SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Web3.py, Solidity smart contracts)
- **Security**: JWT authentication, password hashing, role-based access control

## Project Structure

```
/smart-loans
â”‚â”€â”€ main.py           # FastAPI application with router integration
â”‚â”€â”€ models.py         # Database models (Users, Accounts, Loans)
â”‚â”€â”€ database.py       # SQLAlchemy setup and session management
â”‚â”€â”€ routers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth.py       # User authentication (JWT, login, registration)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admin.py      # Admin functionalities (approve loans, delete users, punish overdue loans)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ users.py      # Loan requests, repayments, ETH transfers
â”‚â”€â”€ contracts/        # Solidity smart contracts
â”‚â”€â”€ enums.py          # Enum definitions for interest rates, payments, and bid status
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yaakov-koby-israeli/Smart-Loans---Beta.git
   cd Smart-Loans---Beta
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Security Measures

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based user authentication.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Restricts sensitive operations to authorized users.
- **Blockchain Verification**: Ethereum transactions ensure secure, auditable payments.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using `passlib`.
